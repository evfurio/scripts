Problem - I know what the TFS build id is... how do I use this to get the project/build?

Solution use this call:
	http://cibuilds.gamestop.com:8080/httpAuth/app/rest/builds/
	examples:
	http://cibuilds.gamestop.com:8080/httpAuth/app/rest/builds/?number="Prod/Rel_20130228_20130228.11"
	http://cibuilds.gamestop.com:8080/httpAuth/app/rest/builds/?number=%22Prod/Rel_20130228_20130227.10%22

why:
	gives me the web url to the build that was being tested.

What project am I testing?
What's the build number in Team City?
What's the TFS build number?
What's the change set web url?
